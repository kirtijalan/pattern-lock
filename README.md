This project implements the Android Pattern Lock feature using React & Redux.

It's an app with 2 functional screens: 
- one screen where the user can set the pattern, and 
- another where the user can validate if the input matches the set pattern.

If the user enters the correct pattern, a message will be displayed for getting authenticated successfully.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
